I'm Python hobbyist by nature and enjoy dabbling.  I did have to reach out to the folks over at the Discord API Discord Server and they were able to help resolve my issues querying the API.  Mainly, I had two spelling mistakes that I was not able to see to the API URL and am grateful for z64's help in resolving my errors!

Game on!
